## Bāduànjǐn/"The Eight Pieces of Brocade"

### 双手 托 天理 三焦 ("Two Hands Hold up the Heavens")
It consists of an upward movement of the hands, which are loosely joined and travel up the center of the body, while the heels are lifted. This move is said to stimulate the "Triple Warmer" meridian (Sanjiao).

### 左右 拉弓 如 射雕 ("Drawing the Bow to Shoot the Hawk (or Vulture)")
While in a lower horse stance, the practitioner imitates the action of drawing a bow to either side. The hand on the stretched arm is put in kiusao, while the other is kept closed, with just the index's knuckle out. It is said to exercise the waist area, focusing on the kidneys and spleen.

### 调理 脾胃 须 单 举 ("Separate Heaven and Earth")
This resembles a version of the first piece with the hands pressing in opposite directions, one up and one down. A smooth motion in which the hands switch positions is the main action. While moving the hands, the body is twisted in order to look at the hand going to the back. It is said to especially stimulate the stomach.

### 五 劳 七 伤 向后 瞧 ("Wise Owl Gazes Backwards (or Looks Back)")
This is a stretch of the neck to the left and the right in an alternating fashion, while placing one hand in the tantien and the other in the back.

### 摇头摆尾 去 心火 ("Sway the Head and Shake the Tail")
In performing this piece, the practitioner squats in a low horse stance, places the hands on thighs with the elbows facing out and twists to glance backwards on each side. Its primary aim is to remove excess heat (or fire) (xin huo) from the heart. Xin huo is also associated with heart fire in traditional Chinese medicine. This is said to regulate the function of the heart and lungs.

### 背后 起点 诸 病 消 ("Bouncing on the Toes")
This is a push upward from the toes, with the hands facing back, as if pushing something back, with a small rocking motion on landing. The gentle shaking vibrations of this piece is said to "smooth out" the qi after practice of the preceding seven pieces.

### 攥 拳 怒目 增 气 力 ("Clench the Fists and Glare Fiercely (or Angrily)")
This resembles the second piece, and is largely a punching movement either to the sides or forward while in horse stance, inhaling while slowly punching, twisting the wrist while exhaling, and then inhaling again while finishing the movement. This, which is the most external of the pieces, is aimed at increasing general vitality and muscular strength.

### 双手 盘膝 固肾 腰 ("Two Hands Hold the Feet to Strengthen the Kidneys and Waist")
This involves a stretch upwards while inhaling, followed by a forward bend while exhaling, a holding of the toes while exhaling, and returning up while exhaling.
