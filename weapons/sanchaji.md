### How to use

> If heavy and massive are the opposite of light and dainty, then the trident is the antithesis of the Chinese sword. While the sword is like a shy lady, the trident is like an insistent bully, always attempting to knock down the opponent’s weapon by its massive weight. Sheer weight, however, is not its only asset. In the hands of a skilful exponent, its three heavy prongs can be used to lock or disarm an opponent. Moreover, it is more difficult for an opponent ora a weapon to get past the three prongs of a trident and move along the shaft to strike the user than to get past the heads or the blades of other long weapons. There is also another interesting advantage in learning to use the trident. According to  Chinese mythology, it is the most popular spiritual weapon for chasing away, or keeping under control, evil spirits. So, by practicing with this weapon, you may acquire some of this aura.
